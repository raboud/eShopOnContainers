Champignon is an extract of the Agaricus bisporus mushroom and has been shown to help the body maintain a healthy ratio of creatinine in the blood versus the urine. Panax quinquefolius, better known as American ginseng, is protective of kidney physiology and function. Astragalus provides support for healthy fasting glucose levels, along with healthy albumin levels in the urine.",

				"Description": "Cardio Essentials™ is a combination of four targeted nutritional formulas packaged together to provide convenience and comprehensive cardiovascular support.*\\nCoQmax ME™ is XYMOGEN’s proprietary, micro-emulsified, 50 mg CoQ10 for convenient dosing. The formula offers unparalleled absorption and bioavailability. CoQmax ME has been shown in clinical trials to be over eight times more absorbable than powdered CoQ10 and more than twice as bioavailable as oil-based or so-called “nano”-dispersed formulas on the market. CoQmax ME’s proprietary multi-lipid carrier is a formulation that is unmatched for optimal utilization in the support of cardiovascular and energy-based health needs.*\\nNiaVasc™ is XYMOGEN's sustained-release niacin that uses proprietary wax-coated technology. The formula supports the maintenance of healthy lipid levels equally as well as the instant-release forms of niacin do, but with dramatically less flushing. Nearly every panel of experts, including the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) panel, considers niacin an important nutrient for support of  cardiovascular health.*\\nOmegaPure 600 EC™ is International Fish Oil Standards (IFOS) five-star certified, which assures the highest level of purity, stability, and potency in fish oils. Each fish-gelatin–based softgel provides 600 mg of EPA and DHA. The softgels are covered with a GRAS-certified enteric coating so that they are easy to swallow and the EPA/DHA content is optimally absorbed. EPA and DHA from fish oil promote wellness by supporting cardiovascular health, cytokine balance, joint health, and brain and nervous system function.*\\nRed Yeast Rice is developed by fermenting Monascus purpureus (red yeast) on commercially grown rice.  It has been found to naturally support healthy blood lipid levels already in the normal range. This formula is citrinin-free.*",

Data suggest that in comparison to synthetic folic acid, 5-MTHF increases plasma folate more effectively. In this formula, 5-MTHF is provided as Quatrefolic®—the glucosamine salt of 5-MTHF. Quatrefolic has demonstrated greater stability, solubility, and bioavailability when compared to calcium salt forms of 5-MTHF.",
